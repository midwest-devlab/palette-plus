# Contributing to Palette+

Thanks for considering a contribution! ðŸŽ‰

## How we work
- Small, focused PRs are best.
- Prefer issues before major feature changes.
- Keep PR descriptions clear; include screenshots/GIFs for UI changes.

## Dev setup (coming soon)
Weâ€™ll use pnpm workspaces. Once the scaffold is pushed, run:
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm -r dev

```

Commit style

Use conventional commits when possible:

feat(ui): add tooltip preview
fix(ext): clipboard on firefox
chore: bump deps

Code style

- TypeScript + React
- Tailwind for styling
- Accessibility: keyboard and screen-reader labels matter
